During my semester project in 2020, I undertook the development of a web project named ShopCity, demonstrating my proficiency in both PHP and Laravel. The project involved the creation of two distinct versions, each utilizing a different technology stack. The frontend was meticulously crafted using a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery to ensure a polished and responsive user interface. For the backend, I employed PHP and Laravel, leveraging their robust frameworks to implement powerful and scalable functionalities. To manage and persist data, I utilized SQL, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms. This dual-technology approach showcased my versatility and ability to implement solutions across various platforms, contributing to a comprehensive and well-rounded skill set in web development.
